# üöÄ CrackingTheCodingInterviewWithSlytherin üöÄ

Greetings, young witch or wizard! üëã Welcome to the Chamber of Coding, a secret chamber beneath the dungeons of Hogwarts, Slytherin House's pride. This isn't just any repository; it's your enchanted guide to mastering "Cracking the Coding Interview" with the cunning and resourcefulness of a true Slytherin.

## What's Inside the Chamber? üêç

Venture deep into the chamber to find Python solutions for the most challenging puzzles from the muggle book. Whether you're a beginner in the magical arts of coding or already a master of spells, there's magic here for you.

### Features

- **Solutions in Python**: As spoken in Parseltongue, for elegance and power.
- **Enchanted Comments**: Because every spell requires an incantation.
- **A Dash of Dark Magic**: Beware! There might be challenges as tricky as facing a Basilisk.

## How to Contribute to the Dark Arts? ü§ù

Wish to add your own dark magic? Your contributions are welcome! Here's how you can contribute:

1. **Fork** this repository (It's like creating a Horcrux, but safer and GitHub-approved).
2. **Clone** your forked version to your local spellbook.
3. **Branch Out**: Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourMagicalFeature`).
4. **Commit** your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some DarkMagic'`).
5. **Push** to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourMagicalFeature`).
6. Open a **Pull Request**. Let the magic unfold!

### Rules of the Dark Arts

- Be respectful and constructive. Remember, even Draco had his moments.
- Stay on topic. We're here to conquer the coding world, one spell at a time.
- No unforgivable curses: All contributions must adhere to the [GPLv3 license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), ensuring all spells remain free and open.

## The Spellbook üìú

Want to run the solutions on your own machine? Here's how you can summon them:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AadityaMuley/CrackingTheCodingInterview-PythonSolutions.git
```
```bash
cd CrackingTheCodingInterview-PythonSolutions
```
```bash
python3 the_solution_you_want_to_run.py
```
Replace the_solution_you_want_to_run.py with the name of the Python file you wish to execute. Abracadabra!

## License üìö

This repository and its enchanted scripts are bound by the powerful [GPLv3 license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), a spell that ensures all wizards, witches, and even Muggles can freely share, modify, and distribute these magical solutions.

## A Final Note from the Head of Slytherin House üêç

If you've managed to decode the secrets of this tome, congratulations! You possess true Slytherin cunning and resourcefulness. üåü Remember, in the world of coding, much like in the halls of Hogwarts, magic is real. It‚Äôs found in the beauty of a well-crafted algorithm and the charm of a cleverly solved problem.

Through these solutions, you're learning to speak in Parseltongue, whispering to the serpents of Python that slither through our digital realm. Let these spells be your guide as you navigate the ever-twisting chambers of technology, outwit the Voldemorts of bugs, and unlock the Chamber of Secrets that is your untapped potential.

Happy coding, and may your code always compile on the first try (but if it doesn't, remember that even Dumbledore occasionally made mistakes).

P.S. Watch out for the basilisk. In coding, it often takes the form of an infinite loop...

Sincerely,

Aaditya Muley, Proud Member of the House of Slytherin
